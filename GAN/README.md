# GAN (General Adversarial Networks)
* GANs are composed of a **generator** network and a **discriminator** network


### Challenges with Tabular GANs
* Different data types (Int, Float, Categories, Date, etc)
* Different shapes of distribution (Non-Gaussian)
* Sparse One-Hot-Encoded vectors taking memory space
* Imbalanced categorical columns
