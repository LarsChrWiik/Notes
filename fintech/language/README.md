# Programming Language in FinTech
Discussions about the leading programming languages in the FinTech space.


### Python
* Python dominates FinTech interviews (HackerRank) and are twise as normal then the runner up Java
* Easy and clear to read, which is essential for finance
* Massive library support
* Best support for AI, ML, data science which is essential in financial services
* Python is the fastest growing language in finance
* Reliable when it comes to security
* Used a lot in fraud detection
* Super fast development
* Security is a number of first-class features in Django
* How to optimize for security
    * Only use open source libraries from trusted sources
    * Update libraries as soon as security fixes comes out
    * You might even want to fork libraries and have them in your own github and apply security fixes and have full control of what is going on


### Go
* Developed by Google and released in 2012
* Fast taking over from Java as the industry standard for FinTech
* Considered simple, scalable, and easy to maintain
* Well suited to running high load, distributed applications built on a microservices architectural foundation
* Built for high-load systems
* Compiles directly to native machine code
* Does not have an extensive library and does not support inheritance
* Does not support object-oriented programming
* Has no GUI library


### Java
* Popular in the banking
* Easy to hire for
* Considered a secure programming language
* Offers enhanced security and cross platform capabilities


### C / C++
* Very fast
* Decent langauge for AI and ML
* A bit hard to learn
* Syntax can be cryptic
* Was dominating FinTech back end the days (most legacy systems use C++)


### C#
* Many libraries
* Build to be easy and secure
