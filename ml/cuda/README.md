# Cuda
* CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
* NVIDIA's application API for parallel computing
* Allows CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) to be used for general purpose processing. GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units).
* Not all GPUs are CUDA-compatible. CUDA can only be used with GPUs that support the CUDA architecture, typically NVIDIA's own GPUs.
* GPUs have thousands of smaller, more efficient cores designed for parallel performance


### How to install in Windows
