# Lifting


### Bodybuilding (Hypertrophy) vs powerlifting (Strength)
If you want to look strong, you should train like a bodybuilder. If you want to be strong, you should train like a powerlifter:
* **Bodybuilding**:
    * Focus on aesthetics
    * Focus on hypertrophy
    * Focus on isolation exercises
    * Focus on high volume
* **Powerlifting**:
    * Focus on strength
    * Focus on compound exercises
    * Focus on low volume
    * Focus on low reps
* **Hypertrophy**: The increase in the size of a muscle through an increase in the size of its component cells. For building hypertrophy, you should focus on bodybuilding.
    * Science suggest that **Tension** is the most important factor for hypertrophy. One technique to increase tention is by using **eccentric training**.
* **Strength**: The ability to exert force on physical objects using muscles. For building strength, you should focus on powerlifting.


### Sets to Failure
Sets should be hard.

**Isolated Excesises**: should ideally be taken to failure or close to failure 0-2 reps in reserve.

**Compound exercises**: Should not be taken all the way to failure before the last set. This because compound exercises like squats and deadlifts are very taxing on the body, and taking them to failure cause more fatigue, ingury risk, and reduce volume for the workout.


### Progressive overload
Always try to increase the weight or the reps you lift over time!

Progressive overload means that you should increase either the weight or the reps you lift over time. This is the most important factor for building muscle.


### How much protein per day
* Around 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.

So if you weigh 90 kg, you should eat 180 grams of protein per day.

However, trianing is much more important than protein intake. If you don't train, you won't build muscle, no matter how much protein you eat.


### How many sets per week?
* 10-20 sets per week per muscle group
    * Example: Bench press includes chest, front shoulders, and triceps
* Overtraining usually occurs when you do more than 20 sets per week per muscle group


### How many sets per workout session?
* Science suggest that more than 6 sets per workout session is not beneficial


### How many reps per set
The more important thing is to train to failure, or close to failure, than to focus on the number of reps per set. But to limit junk volume, you should aim for around 5-15 reps depending on the exercise.

**Isolated Exercises** should be done with higher reps, around 10-15 reps per set.

**Compound Exercises** should be done with lower reps, around 5-10 reps per set.

A rep count between 1-5 can be used in occasions to increase strength.


### General rule for working a muscle
* The muscle should be worked in the same direction as its fibers run. It is therefore very important to know the direction of the fibers of the muscle you are working.
* The most resistant should be worked where the strength is greatest.


### Long-Length Partials
* New studies suggest that long-length partials are the best way to build muscle. It is measured to be better for muscle growth than short-length partials, and even full reps too. The growth increase is measured to be +5-10% compared to full range of motion.
* Reps that are not 100% completed starting from the most stretched position on the mucle.
    * Example 1: Biceps curls where you don't go all the way down.
    * Example 2: Squats where you don't go all the way up.
    * Example 3: Pull down where you don't go all the way up.
