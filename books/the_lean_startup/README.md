# The Lean Startup
The ultimate goal of the Lean Startup principle is to:

```Improve the success rate of new innovative products worldwide```


# Summary
The main idea of the learn startup method is to `Systematically figure out the right thing to build.`.

The main question is not `Can this product be built?` but rather `Should this product be built?` and `Can we build a sustainable business around this product or service?`.

Summary checklist for your startup:
* Have a good idea
* Create a clear strategy and vision for the product
* Break the vision down into the **Value hypothesis** and the **Growth hypothesis**.
* Validate the idea through market research
* Esablish clear hypotheses about how customers will interact with the product
* Have a clear idea of what a *normal* customer looks like
* Build an MVP (make it simple!)
* Validate if the vision is true
* Target early adopters
* Sell to customers before the product is ready
* Create metrics for users by placing them in chohorts
* Continually create new hypotheses and apply the **build-measure-learn** technique to achieve **validated-learning** by measuring customer behaviour changes that correlates with product changes
* Use customers for testing and experimentation
* Continually evaluate whether to **pivot or perserve** when the results from the build-measure-learn cicle completes
* Hold innovators accountable for their outcomes (**innovation accounting**)
* At some point, we may need to pivot to target mainstream consumers instead of early adopters


### Entrepreneurs Characteristics
* Embrace new thinking
* Keeps focusing on distribution and innovation through uncertain times
* Disregard boundaries
* Are enthusiastic
* Dares the world to stop them
* Assemble great people


### Vision, Strategy, Product
A vision does not change.

A strategy is:
* The business model
* Product roadmap
* Knowing the competitors
* Knowing who the customers are

We can **Pivot** the strategy if we encounter setbacks.

The product is the end result of the strategy. And the product can be optimized or changed if we encounter setbacks.


### Minimum need for a startup
* Are based on a good idea and plan to execute it
* Have a solid strategy
* Have validated the idea through market research


### The initial irrational lean strategy
* Do everything wrong
* Create a minimum terrible MVP and ship it to customers before it is ready
* Ship new updates multiple times daily
* Use customers for testing and experimentation
* View customer feedback as a single source of information and not the truth and assess if the feedback alines with the overall vision
* Remove the enormous waste in product development cycle


### The Lean Startup Method
1. **Entrepreneurs are everywhere**: Anyone that create a product or service under extreame uncertainty.
2. **Entrepreneurship is management**: Management focus on extreame uncertainty.
3. **Validate vision**: Startups exist to learn how to build a sustainable business by running experiments to validate all elements of their vision.
4. **Build-Measure-Learn**: Turn idea to product, measure how customer respond, either continue or pivot. Accelerate this feed-back-loop.
5. **Innovation accounting**: Measure progress, have milestones, prioritize work, and hold innovators accountable for their outcomes.


### Entrepreneurial management
* The "Just do it" approach will lead to failure


### Frequest testing
If an organisation fasilitates for single testing over a longer period of time, then the company becomes a set of politicians and salesmen since people have to try to get their ideas through.

Instead, the organisation should facilitate for each inidivual running their own tests in parallel.

Senior management has the responsibility to facilitate for this.


### The customer does not always know what they want
Even if customers says they do no what a product, it does not mean that the product is useless. It might be that a slight midification of the product will make the customer happy.


### Validated learning
All effort that does not try to figure out what the customer wants should be eliminated. What we learn should also be relevant.

It is way too easy to kid yourself on what the customer wants. And proceeding a false assumption is a massive waste.


### True startup productivity
Systematically figure out the right thing to build.


### Basic tactics
* Launch a low-quality early prototype
* Charge customers from day one
* Use low-volume revenue targets as a way to drive accountability

But, its not like this all the time. Not all customers agree to pay for a low quality prototype.

The question is not **Can this product be built?** but rather **Should this product be built?** and **Can we build a sustainable business around this product or service?**.


### Fail and learn
If you cannot fail, you wont learn.

This is why the "lets try it and see what happends" approach is not that good - it might not lead to any learning since there are no goals and no way to fail.


### Validated learning with a vision
A startup is an experiment to validate the vision.
* Make a clear hypothesis with predicted outcome/response from the customers
* Test the predictions emperically and get information from multiple sources (not only market research)
    * Making an MVP and test how the customers respond
        * This approach might lead to more learning that market research since it leads to observing real customer behaviour instead of hypotetical questions.
        * Showcases real customers needs
        * Opens up for revealing information and problems that we do not know.
    * A/B testing of existing product
* Learn and repeat until we have a sustainable business around the vision


### How to break down a potetial product idea
Define the **Grand vision**. The break it down into the **Value hypothesis** and the **Growth hypothesis**.
* **Value hypothesis**: How is the product valuable to the customer?
    * When a customer donate their time to something, it is a strong indication that they find it valuable.
* **Growth hypothesis**: How will the product grow / aquire new customers?
    * Measure how well the product spreads between employees or departments for the customers. When an employee spread the word to another employee, then it is a strong idication that the product has good growth potential and value.

**Concierge MVP**: Find early adopters. Make their experience as good as possible. And focus on what the customers actually do, not what they say.

Test whether the customers will return and whether there is something wrong with the product. Figure out what is wrong and make a choice - either **improve the issues**, or **pivot** he product.


### The feedback loop
Ideas -> Build -> Product -> Measure -> data -> learn -> Ideas

The feedback data is both qualitative and quantitaive:
* Qualitative: Spesific user feedback
* Quantitative: Measure of how many people use the product

**Build-Measure-Learn**:
* Figure out what we need to learn
* Use *innovation-accounting* to figure out what we should measure, to learn whether we are achieving *validated-learning*
* Figure out what product we need to build to run that experiment to get the measurements


### The customer archetype
A startup should clarify what features of a normal customer is. This archetype should be the guide for the product development and make sure that all teams aim to optimize value for this customer.


### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
An MVP is the fastest way of getting through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with minimum effort. The goal of the MVP is to test the initial business hypothesis.

Many overestimate the required features in an MVP. If in doubt, then simplify the MVP.

Example:
* Dropbox: Instead of developing ground braking sync from local to cloud, they made a video showing how it worked and analysed the number of people signing up for beta. The numbers skyrocketed - indicating that poeple were interested.
* Concierge: Manually went home to a few customers to personalize and optimize their grocerie shopping and suggested new recipies based on what they liked. They asked for a small weekly payment for ensure customers were willing to pay. All this before building any software to automate it.
* Aardvark: Used "Wizard of Oz testing" (faking a service so the customer thinks they are interacting with a service that actually does not exist).


### From the customer perspective
Customers do not care about how long it takes for a feature/product to be built, their only care is if it serves their needs.

The point here is that an MVP with low quality features might showcase that some "low quality" features actually solves the customers needs better than a "high quality" feature would.

A real MVP should be designed to question the assumptions we are making about what the customers want from the product.
* If reaction is expected, then we have validated our expectations
* If the reaction is unexpected, then we have counter evidence for our hypothesis

Regardless, we have achived **validated learning**.


### MVP - Keep in mind
*Remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute to the learning you seek*.

Common speed bumps:
* Legal issues
* Fear of competitors
* Branding risks
* The impact on morale


### The truth about the "Stealth startup"
If a competitor can out-execute a startup when they know the "idea", then the statup is doomed anyway.

You should only pursue a startup idea if you believe that you can execute the build-measure-learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can. A head start is rarely good enough anyway, the speed of inovation is the most important.

*The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else*.

The brand risk of an MVP can be avoided by branding the MVP as a seperate entity within the organization.


### Innovation Accouting
Innovation accounting is a technique to extract the right lessions from changes in an uncertain environment.

The innovation accounting technique:
1. Use an MVP to establish a baseline for where the company is at.
2. Move from baseline to ideal by learning effectivly.
3. Pivot or perservere.


### Smoke test
A smoke test is designed to identify whether customers are interested in trying a product.

Example, trying to sell the product through the website before it is built.

This should validate the first learnings of the startup.


### Simply said how a startup should start
* Create a clear baseline of where the company is at.
* Make an hypothesis about what is need to improve the baseline metric.
* Design experiments about how to validate the hypothesis.
* Run the experiments and measure metric changes.


### Cohort analysis
Graph and analysis of dividing customers into cohorts and analysing their behavior in % of how new customers move from one cohort to the next. In sales, it is called sales funnel.

Example of cohorts:
* Registered users
* Users logged in one time
* Users that used the service 1 time
* Users that used the service 5 times
* Paying customers

It is important to measure the % changes in the cohort when new product updates are released to try to measure the release's impact. The interesting this about showing this in % is that we can measure a systematic change in user behavior.

If we were to plot this without using %, then we would perhaps see an exponential graph or revenue and growth and be happy. But that graph would not be that insiteful when measuring the impract of product releases.

The % metric are called **actionable metrics** in the book.


### Kanban validated
To ensure validated learningm, we have have a kanban board with the following blocks:
* Backlog
* In progress
* Built
* Validated

All new features need to be validated and we need to have achived validated learning from the feature. The feature can be A/B tested to get the metrics we want.

An important feature about this method is that it is not possible to validate a feature without fully understanding why it was implemented - meaning that the WHY is clear throughout the implementation process.


### Metric - Ationable, Accessible, Auditable
* Actionable: A clear cause effect must be possible to obeserve in the metric
* Accessible: The metrics must be accessible to the entire organization
* Auditable: The metric must be consistent with reality and not in any way doubthfull to the person looking at the metric
    * Make it possible to double check the data with the customer directly
    * The system generating the report should not be too complicated to reduce risk of errors


### Pivoting + Metric = Validated learning
When metrics for the current system is not good enough, we should consider pivoting. Keeping what works about the current solution, and trying to enter a new market.

There are different ways or pivoting, example, going from B2C to B2B.

If money is becoming a problem, we can cut staff and keep pivoting.

Do not raise money without positive merics - it can be very costly and cause presure, and the startup might go under.


### A Startups Runnway = Number of Pivots left
It does not help to reduce cost if it slows down the build-measure-learn feedback loop - it only helps the company to die more slowly.

The goal is to increase the build-measure-learn feedback loop while keeping costs low. The more we learn, the faster we can pivot to something that works, and the faster we can come up with a product that will generate income.

**If you ask any entrepreneur that has completed a pivot, they will say that they wish they did it sooner**.


### Customer Segment Pivot
After the product has been tuned using the build-measure-learn method to aquire early adopters, it is time to aquire **mainsteam adopters**.

When the product is at this stage, the product hypothesis is confermed (partially).

Mainsteam adopters are much more demanding and it is important to gather feedback from these types of users.


### Types of Pivot
A **pivot** is essentially just a test of a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business mode, and/or engine of growth.

Types of Pivot:
* **Zoom-in Pivot**: Pivot the product by only focusing on a single subset of the original product.
* **Zoom-out Pivot**: Pivot that extends the current product with additional features.
* **Customer Segment Pivot**: Pivot to a different customer group than we thought needed the product. This means that the original product is a good product, but was designed for a different type of customer.
* **Customer Need Pivot**: Pivot to solve another customer need than the original product.
* **Platform Pivot**: Pivot from the original solution / application to a platform where the application can be used by third-parties.
* **Business Architecture Pivot**: Changing that business group, example, from B2C (low margin, high volume) to B2B (high margin, low volume).
* **Value Capture Pivot**: Fundamentally change how the product produce value to customers.
* **Channel Pivot**: Change the way the product is handed to the customer. For exmaple, move to "direct sale to comsumers".
* **Technology Pivot**: Pivot the technology of the product, to make it better or more appealing.


### Single Piece Flow
Compleating a chain of process sequentially will usually lead to faster completing than splitting the objective into multiple tasks and repeating the tasks individually in sequence. This is counterintuitive, but there are some reasons:
* Compleating the entire chain will lead to faster discorvery of issues --> less waste
* Overlead in repeating the same task may not be easy to take into consideration


### Customer pull + experiments
Every product should allow customers to ask for new feautures "pull". However, these requests should only be used by the product team for coming up with new experiments. The experiments should be designed to validate learning.

The reason we should not just implement what the customers request is because they often do not know what they actually want.


### Sustainable growth
Sustainable growth is when "New customers come from the actions of past customers".

Ways past customers can drive growth:
1. **Word of mouth**.
2. **As a side effect of product usage**. Example, a friend is exposed to PayPal when another friend tries to send money.
3. **Payed advertisement using revenue**. This require Customer Acquisition Cost (called marginal cost) to be lower than the revenue that a customer generates (called marginal revenue).
4. Recurring sales from existing customers


### Innovation in bigger Companies
Three main attributes to facilitate:
* **Scarce but secure resources**: Do not overfund a startup since it need to have urgency (aka see .com bubble). But startups need "some kind" of funding to stay alive. And ideally, these resouces should be safe to prevent the startup from suggenly dying.
* **Independent authority**: Startups need complete autonomy. No need for approvals. Cross functional teams to speed up product shipping and to increase the build-measure-learn cycle + increase accountability of the product as a team.
* **Personal stake**: Key people involved in the startup need to have an upside to create incentive to work hard. Feks, through stock options. Other form of invectives are also possible such as credit or alining the startups goals towards strong values of the founders.

Points to facilitate for teams:
* **Any team can create split-tests**: All teams should be able to test their hypothesis with a split-test and learn from it.
* **One team must see the project through**: A single team should be responsible for the hypothesis test.
* **Do testing as fast as possible**: Have a limit of allowed time for hypothesis testing.
* **Limited testing on customer**: Tests should only affect a small percent of the customers. This can for example be a spesific % of the total number of customers.
* **Metrics with actionable items**: All experiments have to be evaluated using a standard report with actionale metrics.
* **The same metrics**: The same metrics must be used to evaluate a product.
* **Monitor and abbort**: While a test is running, the customers behaviours and side effects must be monitored and the project must be abborted as soon as possible if things does not work out.
