# Building a Story Brand

## Summary
To be able to trigger the customers interest, you need to imprint a **Story** in their head. In the story, the customer must be the **Hero** and there must be an obvious **Villain** that causes a **Problem** for the hero (the customer must really know the problem and feel the pain). Your company must be the **Guide** for the hero, and will teach the hero how to defeat the problem. You need to spesifically tell how the product is helping the customer avoid a tragic ending to their story or paint a picture of how wonderful the world will be when they **defeat the problem** using your product. When the customer has understood this, the customer must be challanged to take action or proceed by continue the process. The customer must be presented with a plan (**process plan**) with a easy steps for exactly how the customer should take action. We should present a plan (**agreement plan**) that showcase the customer how to overcome their fears of using the product, for example called "easy installment plan". At this point, the customer must be challenged to take action now!

### The SB7 frameworks
1. The customer is the hero, not the brand. The brand is the guide. The customer is the hero when they:
    * Safe money
    * Safe time
    * Builds a network
    * Gaining status
    * Gaining resources
    * Doing the "right thing"
    * Provide a sense of "meaning"
2. Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, while customers buys solutions for internal problems.
    * Our product should be seen as weapons to defeat the "villain", which is the customers problem.
    * The villain is defined not as a feeling, but the thing that cause the feeling.
    * The villain needs to be relatable.
    * One villain is enough.
    * The villain must be real.
3. Customers are not looking for another hero, they are looking for a guide.
4. Customers trust a guide that has a plan. There are two types of plans, a process plan and an agreement plan. 
5. Customers do not take actions unless they are challenged to take action. They need a call to action.
6. Describe how the service is helping the customer avoid a tragic ending.
7. Never assume that customers understand how your brand can change their lifes. You must tell them that.

### How to create the One-Liner
* The strongest advertisements are those that imprints an **aspirational identity** with their product.
* Nike, for example, "honor great athletes and they honor great athletics". So by buying Nike, you buy into this narrative.
* The one-liner must include:
    * The hero
    * The problem
    * The plan
    * The success
* For example "we help busy mothers get a weekly, meaningful workout so they feel healthy and full of energy".
* People need to be able to say "that's me!" When they hear the slogan.

### 3 Need to have's for Hooking the Customer
What you need the customer to understand within 5 seconds:
* What you offer
* How it will make life better for the customer
* How to access it

### The Secret to Hooking the Customer
You need to provide something that helps the customer *survive* in a way that requires as little *calories* to understand. The most efficient way to provide information to minimize calorie burn is through a story.

Stores makes so much sense for customer because it provides:
* The goal
* The challenges
* The way to overcome the challenges

The marketing story is the same as a movie. You need to know who the hero is, who you want to defeat, what challenges are hindering the hero, and what nice things will happens if the hero wins or loses. And the customer must be the hero.

### The 3 types of problems
* **External**: The villain causes external problems.
* **Internal**: Internal problems are more connected to the customers identity.
* **Philosophical**: A problem at a higher level.
A customer wants to solve all these 3 problems with your product.
Example with Tesla:
```
TESLA MOTOR CARS:
- Villain: Gas guzzling, inferior technology.
- External: I need a car.
- Internal: I want to be an early adopter of new technology.
- Philosophical: My choice of car ought to help save the environment.
```

### The 3 ways a really good story can end
Your customer story should try to match one of these endings:
* The hero win some sort of power or position.
* The hero can be unified with someone or something that makes them whole.
* The hero can experience some kind of self-realization that makes them whole.

### How to strengthen your story
* If there is no stake, there is no story.
* Make sure to show what happens if the customer do not engage with your brand.
* People actually care more about loss aversion than potential gains.
* A way to show the customer that they are vulnerable without acting as a fearmongerer is to present facts.
    * For example "30% of bla bla is likely toâ€¦".
* Then try to convince the customer that they need to act.
    * For example "since nobody wants X, you should protect yourself now".
* Then present the call to action to make them prevent this.
* We should challenge them to take action now.
    * For example, "do you want to book an appointment right now?".
* Remember: moderate amount of fear is optimal for a behavior change.

### The Guide
* Your company must position yourself as the guide for the hero.
* There are 2 characteristics for a guide.
    * **Empathic**
    * **Authority / Competency**
* There are two questions people automatically have in their mind when meeting new people:
    * Can I trust this person?
    * Can I respect this person?
    * These two questions can be answered by showing empathy and competency.

### How your Company can become the Guide
You need credability / Authority to be become the guide. Some ways are:
* Show **testimonials** from you customers on your website. Only a few, 3 for example, and short ones.
* Show statistics of how many customers you have helped, and what internal problems you help them solve.
* Show awards your company has won.
* Show what logos are trusting your company.

### Ways to establish Authority and positioning your company as the guide
* Free PDFs
* Free Video series
* Free Podcast
* Free Webinars
* Free sample of your product

### The Process plans (Pre and Post purchase plans)
* After branding ourself as the guide, we need to provide the call-to-action the customer must do using process plans.
* **Pre-purchase plan** (usually less than 6 points):
    * Schedule an appointment
    * Create a customized plan
    * Let's execute the plan together.
* **Post purchase plan** (usually less than 6 points):
    * Download the software
    * integrate database, revolutionize you customer interaction.

### Agreement Plan
* An agreement plan is a list of customer conserns that we agree to help them with.
* This is created to prevent fear from the customer.
* For example, such a plan can be called "easy installation plan".

### Call-to-Action
* After the plans are clear for the customers, they need to be triggered by a call to action!
* This is to wake the customer up from the passive state they are in.
* There are 2 types of call to actions.
    * **Direct**: Pushes customer to buy. Examples, "buy now" or "book an appointment".
    * **Transitional**. Subtitle progress of the relationship, where we usually give something for free first. Examples include offering free webinars or PDFs.

### The 6 most impactful things a company can do
1. Fix your website!
2. Create a one-liner that sets the end user as the hero and communicates a transformation or identity.
3. Create a lead generator.
    * This is basically anything that generates email-addresses that can be converted to leads.
    * This can be PDFs, webinars, video series, events, etc.
4. Automated drip campaign - for example sending emails with campaigns to the emails you have gathered from step 3.
5. Collect and tell stores of transformations
6. Create a referral system.
    * Making happy customers attract other customers is a powerful technique.

### Emails
* Emails are the most values assets for a company for market they product.
* To be able to collect email, you need to provide value (the transitional call to action) and present yourself as the guide.
* The idea with information email / nurturing emails are to provide value and then from time to time have a call to action within the email about your services.
* The call to action email needs to be specific and direct, for example with a limited time period.
* Monthly emails are good regardless if the customers reads the content or not, because they are reminded that we exist.

Formula for a nurturing email:
* Steps:
    1. Talk about the problem.
    2. Explain a plan to solve the problem.
    3. Describe how life can look for the reader once the problem is solved.
    4. Also adding a PS at the end is good since the reader is likely to read this.

### Mission statement
* A clear mission statement is crucial for providing employees the required reason for why they are needed and how their work is contributing towards a bigger goal.
* Companies should also design their work environment with a given "thoughtmosphere", which is a specific set of thoughts that should circulate in the workplace.

### Ways to Fix your Website
* The first thing a customer should see on your webiste is a text explaining what your brand will transform them into, in one line
    * For example "we will make you a pro in the kitchen".
    * The text should be short and bold.
* The text in your website should either:
    * Promise an inspirational identity
    * Promise to solve a problem
    * State exactly what it offers
* Make the entire website simple and add easy to understand with call to action buttons.
* The call to action button should bright and easy to see and be in a different color than any other button, and should be two places:
    * Top right
    * Middle of the screen right under the "transformation statement".
    * This is because readers read in a Z formation at the website.
* The website should also have a "transitional call to action button"
    * For example "download PDF".
    * Ideally it should be a bit less intrusive than that main call to action button and be next to it.
* Lastly, images of happy people enjoying your product always helps.
* A website should have stupidly little words on it.
    * People do not read paragraphs. The fewer words you write, the more likely it is that people will read them.

### How to Communicate with Customers
* Phrases to use to your customers are: "we understand how it feels to â€¦" and "Nobody should have to experience â€¦" and "Like you, we are frustrated by â€¦".

### Mistakes companies do
* **1**: Not focus on aspects of their offers that will help people survive and thrive. All great stores are about survival, either physical, emotional, rational, or spiritual.
* **2**: Force customers to burn too many brain calories to be able to understand their offering and how it will benefit them.

### Example questions we can ask customers to get testimonials
* Page 200.
* What was the problem you were having before you discovered our product?
* What did the frustration feel like as you tried to solve that problem?
* What was different about our product?
* Take us to the moment you realized our product was actually working to solve your problem
* Tell us what life looks like now that your problem is solved

### General info
* Most marketing efforts fail because they are too complicated.
* What we actually say to our customers, and what they hear, is two different things.
* The best leadership advice "always remember that people want to be taken somewhere".
* People constantly scan their surroundings for things to help them get ahead and meaning, regardless if it is advertising or not.
    * Advertisement about the biggest manufacturing plant is useless for a customer since it does not provide our primitive means or give any purpose for the reader.
* Steve Jobs worked at Pixar where he learned the power of storytelling, which later on revolutionized apples branding into two words "think different".
* After the call to action, it is important to show how happy the customer will be after engaging with the product.
* Apple identified the customer's need "to be seen and heard", and identified the challenge "most people was not recognized for their genius", and how to help them achieve their goal "using computers and phones".
* Great companies obsessed over the transformation of their customers.
* Customers want to be seen, heard, and understood.
