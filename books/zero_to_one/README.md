### What is a startup?
* A startup is the largest group of people that you can convince of a plan/conspiracy to build a better future


### Notes for getting investors
* Focus on showing a high potential future cash flow.
* VCs should only invest in companies that has the potential to return the investment of all other companies in the investment portfolio. Rule number two is that there cannot be other rules since the first rule is so restrictive.


### Choosing co-founders
* Choosing a co-founder is like getting married
* Complementary skills are important, but getting along is equally important
* Early team staff members should be on the same page when thinking about the world - this will reduce friction and optimize for speed
* Everyone is optimistic in the beginning, so watch out when people lose their optimism.
* Any misalignments needs to be cleared.
    * **Ownership**: who owns the companies equity?
    * **Possession**: who runs the company on a daily basis?
    * **Control**: who governs the companies affairs? (board of control)
* Everyone involved should be involved **full-time**. Except from accountants, lawyers and such
* A company does better the less it pays the CEO - high salary risks the CEO of becoming a politician


### The 7 question every company should answer
1. Can you create breakthrough tech instead of incremental improvements?
2. Is now the right time to start?
3. Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. Do you have the right team?
5. Do you have a good way to deliver your product to the customers?
6. Will your company be able to defend itself 20 years in the future?
7. Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?


### Start SMALL
* The initial market should appear to be so small it does not appear to be a business opportunities at all
* Choose your market carefully and expand deliberately
* Start with a very small market and become the monopoly in that niche
* It’s easier to dominate a small market then a large one
* When you have concurred the small market, then expand to adjacent markets and avoid competition as much as possible
* The goal of a startup is to become a monopoly. Read monopolies tries to perceive themself as non-monololies, while non-monopolies tried to perceive themself as monopolies.
* Verticle progress means making something that work somewhere, work everywhere. Also known as **globalisation**.
* Horizontal progress means coming up with compleatly new ideas. This is known as **technology**.
* In a startup, you need to work with others to get things done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can
* A company will capture lasting value if they build a unique commody noone else is serving
* We often see either monopolies or hard competing businesses
    * Monopolies lies to protect themself
    * Non-unique businesses lie to seem more interesting
* Happy companies are different from each other by solving unique problems, while failing companies are companies that fail to escape competition


### How to make a company durable
1. **Proportery technology**: Proprietary tech is the most important. It must be 10x better in at least one dimension. Design and increased UX can also play a significant role.
2. **Network effects**
3. **Economics of scale**
4. **Branding**


### The board
* A board of 3 is ideal
* A board should never exceed 5 people if it is privately held


### Hiring
* When hiring, present the company’s mission and why that is specifically important. That is much better than the usual:
    * "Our stock options will be worth a lot"
    * "You will work with smart people"
    * "We solve difficult problems"
* Having people on board with the mission is what retain people


### Motivation of employees
* Sending out a list of company wide employee stock ownership would be like dropping a nuclear bomb
* Company t-shirts/distinguishers are used to make all the people that are different equally different as a tribe


### Selling and marketing
* Selling is underrated
* Marketing is also very important
* It is not enough with just a good product (no matter what the tech people says)
* Science and engineering is perceived as more difficult than it actually is


### Sales in basic
* **CLV** (Customer Lifetime Value) must exceed **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost)
* Your desired sales distribution channel might not exist - Meaning it might be hard to reach out to the correct people. You might need personal sales effort, but that might be more costly than the earnings from the product.
* Focus on doing one distribution channel good instead of failing at multiple channels


### Secrets
* Actively seek to find secrets in the world. You might be able to create business around a secret you find because of the untapped potential.
* There are natural secrets and people secret. Ask, what secrets the nature is not telling us. And, what secrets other people are not not telling you.
* Secrets should be told only to those you need hearing it, and no others.
* Every company contain secrets. And when the secets are shared, the employees become part of the conspiracy.


### AI in the future
* Future companies will not ask how AI can replace people, but how computer can help humans solve hard problems


### Important to remember
* Reason up from first principles
* Competition for the sake of competition is distructive since we start loosing track of our actual goal
* Question recieved ideas and rethink business from scratch
* Try things out, iterate, and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation
* Focus on making a good product that solves a real problem
* In startups, indefinitely optimism does not work. Strategic smart planning always wins.
* Long term planning is often undervalued.
* Do not rely on chance. A startup is not a lottery ticket.
* 80-20 rule. Pareto principle. "80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes".
* Most startups fail and most VC funds die with them
* Owning a small bit of something valuable is better than owning everything if something that will likely fail
