# How to Win Friends and Influence People
Book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie.


### Mistakes people do
* Direct criticizing often leads to resentment.
* Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain, and fools most do.
* If you want to criticize, then do it indirectly. Also with a praise will encourage the behavior change.
* If you want to criticize, start off by explaining your own imperfections, or past imperfections.
* Hurt the other persons pride.
* Do not complain about complain about others mistake when you do them yourself.


### How to make others like you
* The best way to make someone like you is to be genuinely interested in them. Do not just talk about what you are interested in. Same goes for sales.
* Smile and be positive when engaging with others.
    * A smile can actually make you happy.
* Remembering someone’s name is very important. It will make them feel important. And people love feeling important.
    * To remember someone’s name, make sure to listen to it and make sure you know how to spell it. Also try to match their name to featured in their face. Also write it down when nobody is looking.
* Be a good listener and encourage others to talk about themself. Because people care more about themselves than anything else.
* Talk in terms of the other people’s interest.
* Always make the other person feel important.
* Praising specific things sounds more sincere than broad things, and increases the chance of the other person feeling it is sincere.
* Praising others for their improvements are almost always a good idea.


### How to deal with disagreements
* Starting an argument is not worth it since you will lose either way. Either have your pride kicked since you are wrong or, have the other person resent you because their pride was destroyed. If is not going to make you any good in arguing, just avoid it.
* Be thankful when disagreement comes and try to understand the other person viewpoint. They might know something you do not.
* Our first instinct in a disagreement is to be defensive. Avoid that at all cost.
* Listen first, then talk. Understand the other viewpoint instead of adding more misunderstandings.
* If you disagree, look for areas of agreement.
* In a disagreement, look for errors where you might be wrong.
* Remember that the people that disagrees with you are actually interested in what you are debating. So thanking them for their interest is good.
* Principle: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
* Never announce that you will prove this or that to the person you are arguing with. That basically says “I am smarter than you, now listen”.
* Admit it if you are wrong.


### Changing and Influencing other's Opinions
* If you want someone to do something, make them want to do it. And the easiest to play on is "the desire to be great" / "the desire to be important".
* If you want something from someone, talk about what that person wants and argue from there, do not start with how you feel or think or how it affects you, since that is irrelevant for the other person.
* To make people do something, you need to spark a desire within that person. They who cannot do this will walk alone.
* Everyone seeks a feeling of importance.
* There is a saying "Tell me what you do to feel important, and I will tell you who you are".
* The quickest way to enforce behaviour in others are by using appreciation and encouragement.
    * If you want to give appreciation, make sure to be sincere, because flattery is easy to see through.
* People must be thought as if you did not teach them.
* Respect other people’s opinion and not say that they are wrong automatically.
* If you want someone that dislike you to agree with you. No logic can help you. You need to make that person your friend and then I put your ideas.
* Making the other person to say “yes” increases the person to later on agree with you. So to persuade someone, start by asking a question they will reply "yes" and continue the thought from there.
* In a discussion, it is important to let the other person talk until they are finished. Other people feel great when they talk and feel they are listened to.
* Try honestly to see things from the other persons side of things.
* Being sympathetic with the other persons ideas and desires help you win them over to your way of thinking.
* To convince someone, it is worth appealing to the nobler motives. Let the customer be nobel and do the right thing.
* If you dramatize your ideas, like in movies, it helps convince others.
* Everyone wants to excel. Throwing down a challenge might be the most motivating factor to workers that want to show their strength.
* If you want people to accept an idea you have, the best way is to make those people believe the idea is theirs.
* Being respectful is key for making people do what you want. If you can save their face from embarrassment, they will gladly do what you want.
* People love sympathy when they are angry. You can say: "I do not blame you for feeling that. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do".
* If you want to change someone’s behavior, then start with a praise and honest appreciation, then deliver the feedback while remaining the persons pride. Do not use the word "but" after a praise, since it makes the praise seem fake. Use "and" instead since it will contribute the praise and not signal a failure. For example, "You did great in the test, and if you keep this up, you might increase your grades even more".
* When you want to give a direct order, it is often better to ask questions and make the crew come up with the obvious solution since they will feel ownership to the work.
* If you want to improve an ability in others, then pretend they had that ability before and that they have been lacking lately. See page 246 for example.
* If you want someone to do something, then you can make up a story about how great they are at that, and you will see that they improve in exactly that.
* Give the person you want to change a reputation to live up to.
* Telling someone directly that they are wrong is never a good idea. The better way to do it is to tell them what they are doing right, and then mention a small thing they can adjust to make it even better. Make it seem easy and tell you have faith in them improving it.
* If you want to change someone else’s behavior, then make sure that they will be happy with changing it.
