# The hard thing about hard things

### The basic problem solving technique
A basic principle to always follow is "focus hard the the output, and work your way backwards". Then break down the goal and figure out how to know if you progress correctly. Then delegate accountability into the different tasks.

### Company vision and mission
* The company should have a mission that is greater than every persons ambition. This is especially important in the sales department.
* Mission and vision: Mission defines the objectives and how it will reach the objectives. A vision details where the organization aspire to go.

### The CEO
* The CEO needs to be open with the staff about where they stand. Building trust is essential to continue building a company.
* Every CEO makes thousands of mistakes.
* A good CEO is able to make the best move when there is no good move.
* When the CEO sees a huge problem, then it is better to delegate the problem to the people that are responsible for fixing it. This is much more motivating and rewarding for employees. The worst thing is to try to hide the problem from the employees.
* As a CEO, it is easy to feel the pressure to be overly positive, but you should rather try to tell the truth.
* A common fallacy for a CEO is to assume the reason when the company achieves good results, and create excuses for bad results. These people are usually lying to themself about leading indicators without even knowing it.
* The CEO should not make excuses and not the product owner either.
* All hires should be approved by you the CEO, and if the candidate is from a company run by a friend of your, then consider if you want to make the hire or not. You could consider asking the candidate if you could do a reference check with the friend before the hire.
* Things will go sideways, CEOs will make a lot of mistakes. But make sure you do the important things right and not worry to much about everything that goes wrong.
* The only way to learn how to be a CEO is to do it.
* Remarkable CEOs usually wins because they did not quit.
* The CEO should make the final decision since the CEO sits with the most knowledge. It is easy to follow the crowds opinion if you are unsure, but it is better to choose path based on actual data and not employees emotions.
* CEOs enjoy gathering information for a broad variety for sources.
* CEOs usually gets bored talking about processes and training and performance management.
* CEOs do not sweat decision making.
* Hiring CEOs from within is usually wiser than hiring from outside.
* What makes people follow CEOs:
    1. The ability to articulate the vision (Steve jobs style).
    2. The right ambition (make employees feel that they own and are part of a company that wants them to succeed).
    3. The ability to achieve the vision (the CEO needs to show competence).
* As a CEO, you should say what you think and do not hide it. The effect will be that employees do not think feedback has a hidden meaning, and that employees will be comfortable discussing bad news.
* No CEO really thinks they are competent enough to lead hundreds or thousands of people.
* The CEO must the the keeper of the vision and make sure that it is clear and compelling.
* A CEO can be measured by the speed and quality of his decisions.
* Typical questions that the CEO must handle.
    * "What are the competitors doing next?"
    * "What is possible technically and in what time frame?"
    * "What are the true capabilities of the company and how can we maximize them?"
    * "How much financial risk does this take?"
    * "What are the future issues with the current product architecture?"
    * "How will the employees react to this promotion?"
* CEOs cannot be developing other employees. That must be done lower down in the company. If a highly ranked executive suck, then you have hired a person that is not qualified.

### Management
* Hiring a manager that is used to manage huge corporation is a big mistake for a startup. Several new initiatives needs to be done daily in a startup, not just few within a year. Managers from big companies are used to react to others in the organization, while a startup require a manger that creates new initiatives all the time.
* Management debt (similar technical debt) can be expensive. Examples:
    * Overcompensate an employee due to another job offer
    * Having no employee management feedback sessions
    * Having two people run the same role together
* Clarity in company discussions can be crucial to retain employees.
* In One-on-ones, it should be the employee and not the manager that is in control of the time and booking and the agenda. The boss should talk 10% of the time. Ask the employee what the number one problem with the organization is.
* Basic feedback technique "the shit sandwich": Start by complimenting the person, then bring up the shit, then tell how much you value them. This is called "the shit sandwich". This should only be used for junior employees.
* Never embarrass an employee in front of their peers.

### Good vs Bad project management
* One-on-ones are crucial to allow employees raise things they are not happy about.
* Good project managers know the market, and product, where the product is going, and the competition.
* Good project managers measure themself in terms of the products success.
* Good project managers know the company's revenue and the funding plan.
* Bad project managers state several excuses when the product is not performing well.
* Good project managers are not sucked into the company bureaucracy.
* Good project managers are not part of the product team, they are managing the product team.
* Good product managers are the marketing counterpart to the engineering manager.
* Good project managers focuses on the "what" and not the "how".
* Good product managers gather information formally.
* Bad project managers point out that they predicted the product to fail after it failed.
* Good project managers thinks about market share and revenue goals during the go-to-market phase.
* Good project managers decompose problems, while bad ones combine problems.
* Good project managers think about the story they want the press to write.
* Bad project managers focus on being absolutely technical with the press.
* Bad project managers never explain the obvious.
* Bad PMs want to be told what to do.
* Good project managers deliver status reports every week.

### Hiring
* Be clear about expectations when hiring new people.
* New hires should be trained to understand how things are done and what is expected of them.
* The common reason for an engineer to quit is that they hate their manager or they did not learn anything in the role.
* Hiring people to positions you do not anything about can go wrong.
* A common hiring mistake is to overly bias on looks.
* Before a hiring process, it is helpful to write down the strengths you want and the weaknesses you can tolerate.
* When hiring make sure to do the following:
    * Understand what is needed in the role.
    * Make sure the interviewers are prepared.
    * Make sure the interviewers can sell the companies vision.
    * Make sure interviewers arrive on time.
    * Make sure to follow up to each candidate in a timely fashion.
* IQ is not everything. Hiring the person with the highest ambition might be better.

### Layoffs
* If the company needs to do layoffs, then do it fast before it becomes a rumor going around
* If the company needs to do layoffs, then the CEO should admit that they failed and need to lose great employees.
* It should be a company issue and not a personal issue when someone is laid off.
* It should be clear that the employee that will be laid off has been impacted and that the decision is not negotiable.
* The company should have all support plans ready to provide some safely and security to the person being later off.
* The people that stay after a layoff will care deeply about how you treated their layer off colleague.
* When letting an executive go, it is important to let the bord know why and make it a team issue. It does not look good to trash a person you hired.
* Try to not embarrass the person being laid off and try to avoid that the person feels betrayed.
* Avoid emotions when laying off people.
* If you want to remove a person from a position to a less powerfull position, then consider keeping his salary or even give a raise.

### Company culture and motivation
* A healthy company culture encourages people to share bad news
In a "good company" every employees should feel comfortable that if they do good work, then good things will happen for both the company and them personally.
* In a "bad company" employees fight each other and the bureaucracy in the company and all the broken processes. And employees are not even sure what their job is, which is very bad for their motivation.
* If people or department in the organization fight, it might be a good idea to force them to see the situation from the other peoples perspective. For example by switches the team leads.
* Culture is not the most important thing, but it will help you with your company goal.
* Culture can help core values and help the company to become a better place to work while scaling.
* A properly designed culture often looks cult like.
* A culture should have a shock value and create discussions. Shock is a great mechanism for behavior change.
* Designing the right culture will lead to the company doing what the you (the CEO) wants.

### Accountability
* Accountability for results should be accounted in regards to how senior the employee is.
* More senior employees should predict very accurate and be accountable for the predictions.
* Every employee should be accounted for their effort.
* The degree of difficulty must be taken into account when an employee fails to predicts correctly how long a project will take.

### Last resort
* An IPO can be a last resort to get funding if no private investors will
* Selling the entire company can be a company saving event when no funding is possible
* When things do really bad there are usually three options:
    1. Sell the company.
    2. Do layoffs.
    3. Dilute everyone.

### Minimize company bureaucracy
* Hire people with ambition for the company and not themself. Incentives can also be given to adjust behavior for the company good.
* Build strict policies to prevent political issues. Areas include:
    * Performance evaluation and compensation (make these talks predictable and structured)
    * Organizational design and territory (when reorging, do it fast to prevent lobbying)
    * Promotions (when someone get a promotion, others will evaluate if it was caused by skill or political favor. Make sure it seems fair).

### Employee destructiveness
* Employees might be destructive in some perticular cases. Try to avoid these as muich as possible:
    1. The employee is disempowered.
    2. the employee is a rebel.
    3. the employee is immature.

### Selling the company
* If the company can become a monopoly in its sector, and the sector has the petential to grow further, then it is usually unwise to sell the company.
* Types of acquisition:
    * Talent/Tech acquisition: means buying a company for getting the employees and technology (Usually between 5-50 million dollar sales).
    * Product acquisition: means buying a company to get the product to sell it themself (usually between 25 million and 250 million dollar sales).
    * Business acquisition: means buying a company to get the revenue stream (these deals can be very large).

### General points
* You should have at least 2 friends to call when having a startup. One that will be more excited than you when things go good. And another that will support you no matter how bad things look.
* Do not lose focus on what matters, your family and loved ones.
* If your company has a client that expects more than what you can over, you might want to find something else they really want and try to add that to your service.
* If the company start to fail a lot, look forward, not backwards!
* Sometimes there is no silver bullet, you might need to either develop the best product on the market (lead bullet) or not exist at all.
* Figuring out the right product is the investors job, not the customers job
opinions are usually before the first line of code has been written
* Prioritize people, product, profit, in the order.
* Mark Zuckerberg introduced a motto "move fast and break things".
* The first rule of organizational design is that all organizational designs are bad.
* Be sure about what you are not doing. What is the closest thing you are not doing?
* Artificial deadlines can help close deals.
* Company delays will happen when people are unsure if they have authority.
* Quick daily meetings can prevent long delays.
* Topics that become increasingly hard when the company grows are "communication", "common knowledge", "decision making".
