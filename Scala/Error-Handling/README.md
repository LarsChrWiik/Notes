# Error Handling

### try-catch

### Try
Try is used on some function that might throw and error, and it returns a **Success** or a **Failure**.

Example:
```scala
TODO
```

### Either

By convention, the **Left** object represents the error case, while the **Right** object represent the success case.

Example:
```scala
TODO
```
