# Cross Platform Mobile Frameworks
There are two giants in this space, **React Native** and **Flutter**.


### Native vs. Cross Platform
* Smaller companies usually have cross platform apps
* Cross platform apps are cheaper to build since it is faster to build
* Cross platform apps usually runs a tiny bit slower than native apps
* For simple apps, cross platform is probably the best option


### Flutter vs. React Native
* **Flutter**:
    * Created by Google.
    * Programming language **Dart**.
    * Complies to different platforms (iOS and Android).
    * The language is not well known outside the Flutter world.
    * Has a huge library built in, but also open for third party libraries.
    * Renders via an engine called Skia.
    * Can be hard to hire for since Dart is not too well known.
* **React Native**:
    * Created by Facebook.
    * Programming language **Javascript / Typescript**.
    * Is designed to be minimal and are open for third party libraries.
    * Renders thought a bridge between JS and native widgets.
    * Some React libraries are not compatible with react native, such as rendering libraries.
    * Easy to hire for since web-developers understand the language and framework.
    * Runs a lightweight JS virtual machine.


### React Native for Web
* One code base for iOS, Android and Web.
* *React Native for Web* is a compatibility layer between React DOM and React Native.
* Can be used in new and existing apps, web-only and multi-platform apps.
* React Native for Web is made with modern React APIs including function components and hooks.
* React Native for Web should be used when the app and the website experience is very similar.
