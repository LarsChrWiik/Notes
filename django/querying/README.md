# Query Set API
The QuerySet API is used for `creating`, `retrieving`, `updating`, and `deleting` records in the database to abstract away complex SQL queries.

## QuerySet Characteristics
* **Lazy Loading**: evaluated when explicitly requested.
* **Chainable**: Multiple QuerySet methods can be chained together and will return a single QuerySet.
* **Immutable Chaining**: If you chain a queryset with another queryset, the original queryset is not modifed. Instead, a new queryset is created.
* **Caching**: Once a QuerySet is evaluated, it caches the results. This means that operations on the same QuerySet do not hit the database.


# Example Model
Example of a Django model we will use throughout this document:
```python
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```


# Core Methods of the QuerySet API
* **.all()**: Get all records.
* **.filter()**: Get all recods that match the given condition.
* **.exclude()**: Get all recods except when they match the given condition.
* **.get()**: Force return the single object that matches the query. NB: This return the object, not a QuerySet.
* **.create()**: Create new object with the given parameters.
* **.save()**: Save the given object to the database.
* **.update()**: Updates the objects in the QuerySet.
* **.delete()**: Deletes the objects in the QuerySet.
* **.count()**: Returns the number of objects in the QuerySet.
* **.exists()**: Returns True if the QuerySet contains any records with the given condition, False otherwise. Without a condition, it is the same as .count() > 0. Or len(queryset) > 0. It is more efficient as it doesnâ€™t fetch or load any records into Python memory but instead checks at the database level for the firt record that meets the criteria. It uses the `EXISTS` SQL keyword to be more efficient.
* **.order_by()**: Returns a new QuerySet sorted by the given fields.


## Nesting Attribute Querying
To be able to nest attributes in Django, you can use the double underscore syntax.
```py
books_by_john_doe = Book.objects.filter(author__name='John Doe')
```
Note here that author is an attribute of Book, and name is an attribute of Author. We can traverse the obects by using the double underscore syntax author__name.


## Filter

### Filter in exact attribute value
```python
MyModel.objects.filter(id=123)
```

### Filter on nested attribute
```python
has_books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains='Python')
```


## Exclude

### Exclude exact attribute value
```python
MyModel.objects.exclude(id=123)
```

### Exclude on nested attribute
```python
MyModel.objects.exclude(title__icontains='Python')
```


## Exists
```python
MyModel.objects.filter(title__icontains='Python')
```


# Field Lookups
The QuerySet API supports different types of comparisons when querying data.
These types of comparisons are called field lookups.

The `i` in front of some of the lookups means that the comparison is case-insensitive.

### contains
```python
books_containing_python = Book.objects.filter(title__contains='Python')
```

### icontains
```python
books_containing_python = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains='python')  # Case insensitive
```

### exact
```python
specific_book = Book.objects.filter(title__exact='Python Programming')
```

### iexact
```python
specific_book = Book.objects.filter(title__iexact='python programming')  # Case insensitive
```

### gt (Greater Than)
```python
books_after_id_10 = Book.objects.filter(id__gt=10)  # Get all books with ID greater than 10
```

### lt (Less Than)
```python
books_before_id_10 = Book.objects.filter(id__lt=10)  # Get all books with ID less than 10
```

## on_delete CASCADE on foreign key
Assume you have ModelA that has an attribute X that is a foreign key to ModelB.
If you use `on_delete=models.CASCADE` on the `ForeignKey`, it means that if you delete ModelA, it's related ModelB will also be deleted. But not the other way around.

Example:
```python
class PostalCode(models.Model):
    postal_code = models.CharField(max_length=10, unique=True)
    city = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    state = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    country = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Address(models.Model):
    street = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    postal_code = models.ForeignKey(PostalCode, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

In this case, each Address instance is associated with one PostalCode instance, implying that multiple addresses can share the same postal code.

Here, if a PostalCode instance is deleted, then all the Address instances associated with that postal code will also be deleted due to on_delete=models.CASCADE.

And if an Address instance is deleted, then the associated PostalCode instance will not be deleted.

In short, deleting an object that has `on_cascade`` should not cause a chain reaction of deletions. But when deleting an object, check if any other models has on_cascade on the object you are deleting - in that case, those objects will also be deleted.

ON_CASCADE logic should never be circular. It is always a DAG.
