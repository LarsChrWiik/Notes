# Antler summary notes


### Terms
* Net Promoter Score (NPS): NPS measures customer experience and predicts business growth.


### Sayings about how to build a startup
* Find a fragmented industry with bad customer experience, and integrate a simple solution
* You need to create a 10x product
* You have to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the customer
* If you want to get a startup idea, try to not think of a startup idea


### Start with the problem
Understand and the obsessed with the problem:
* Problem identification --> Problem validation --> Build a solution
    * Understand why we validate what we validate
    * Use hypothesis-driven thinking


### Organic vs. deliberate ideas
* **Organic idea**: An idea that emerges from the founders own experience. Organic ideas as generally more successful than thought-up ideas.
    * Are there obvious opportunities in your industry? Any outdated technologies, unserved customers, fragmented competitors?
    * Are the any business model that has not been applied to your expertise?
    * Is your field in a rappid change? Can you bring a solution to market?
    * What has been on your problem/idea list for a long time?
    * This exsures that the problem exists
    * The absolute most common mistake is to make solutions for problems that does not exist
    * Ask yourself if you in your previous job ever said "why does X not exist?"
    * If you came up with the idea without having experienced it yourself, then you need to make a huge effort really understanding the problem
    * Do not get carried away with a solution. You are likely going to need to pivot.
* **Deliberate**: Problems that are "thought up". Have you constructed a problem for a topic you are passionate about solving?
    * Deliberate require more effort of problem validation compared to organic ideas.


### What is a real problem?
It is said that startups needs to be "pain killers", and not "vitamin pills". In other words, the product needs to solve real issues, not be "nice to have".


### Who is the first customers?
The first customer is those that willing to buy a really bad version 0 product from a two-person startup.
* It is much better to have very few customers that really benefit from your product, rather than helping many customer by very little
    * Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.‚Äù


### Characteristics of a good problem to solve
* **Painful**: So painfull that customers are willing to pay
* **Popular**: So popular that many people are affected
* **Frequently**: Users encounter the problem several times daily
* **Urget**: Needs to be solved right now
* **Growing**: Structurally growing potential market
* **Unavoidable**: The problem will still exists, even with regulations


### Investors pre-revenue and pre-product
For investors investing pre-revenue and pre-product, founder-market fit becomes incredibly important.
* Understanding the problem is essential
* Founder-market fit is about domain expertise and skills
* Does the strength of the founding team match the challanges of the business


### Points on founder market-fit
* What **credability** do you have in the market?: You need to be credible to be able to sell in e.g. security, healthcare, fintech, and so on
* What **skills** are needed in the market?: Do you have the skills? Can you learn the skills? Can you hire the skills?
* What **unique point of view** do you bring to the space?: What is unique about how you tackle the problem?
* What **unfair advantage** do you have in the space?
* Does your team have the right **soft skills* for the market?


### Hypothesis driven
It is generally agreed that adopting a hypothesis driven approach is good in a startup.

"I have this hypothesis. How can I test if this is true or not in an objective way?"

Having a scientific approach will help the startup pivot more frequently.


### B2C or B2B
B2B is generally less complex and more predicable than B2C.

Be mindfull about these:
* **Cost**: Is the product too expensive for the customer compared to the bennefit it provides?
* **Convenience**: How convenient is the solution for the customer? Is it too hard to solve the issue themself or find another solution? You should aim to be 10x better than alternatives.
* **Moral**: Does your solution solves a morale problem?


### Market shift / catalysts
A Market shift / catalysts usually create opportunities for startups, since they usually spawn new ways of operating in an industry.


### Distribution channel
The very aware of what distribution channel you choose to operate in.
* Do you have a small proprietary channel you can use? Can you use a small new network platform to get less competition? For example, TikTok or Shopify?


### Market players
Methods of developing new market players:
* **Juxtaposition**: Take a business model that is working in one market and apply it to a different category or market with similar dynamics.
* **Fast followers / clones**: Develop a business similar to an existing business that has been observed to do well.
    * This works well in non-winner-take-all markets, or markets that cannot scale fast globally.


### Unbundling to new product
* Start a business that takes an existing business and takes it apart to create a smaller and more targeted product.
    * Example: Instagram unbundles Facebook
* Can also unbundle a spesific part of a chain in a product, example what a normal division team are doing.


### Tech-enabling legacy businesses
Can be applied when we see a legacy market that can be seriously improved in core operations through tech.
* Build a business that is similar to an existing business that is outdated
* Create innovative tech to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and/or increased value
* Buy the legacy businesses to aquire the existing customers


### Shrink a market
Building a bussines by creating a much ceaper product than a competitor.


### Problem validation
* Validation is continuous
    * Avoid solving a problem that does not exist (or is not attractive to solve)
    * Develop and test hypotheses of what the solution should look like
    * Make sure to also validate what the customer looks like
    * Avoid long product development cycles - avoid and reduce cost of developing the wrong solution


### Example of problem validation and hypothesis thinking
**Airbnb**
Hypotheses:
1. Property owners are comfortable with renting their house to strangers online
2. Customers are comfortable with renting a stay from a strangers house
3. Customers are willing to pay $X for renting


### Some tips for writing good, strong hypotheses
* Know the questions you are investigating
* Make sure the hypotheses is testable (we need to be able to prove or disprove it)
* Make sure the hypotheses are super simple to understand
* Hypotheses are statements, not questions - state the assumption!


### Pitfalls when validating ideas
* Avoid confirmation bias of your hypotheses (especially if you are passionate)
* Do not look at research outcomes as the fact, but rather indications
* Do not rely on users telling you what to do


### Problem framing
State the vision of the company, then create hypothesis around these points:
* What is the problem you are solving?
* What is the solution to the problem?
* What is the business model?
* What is the competition?
* What is the market size?
* Why is your team better suited what the competition?

We can then start to validate the idea by figuring out:
* What do we know about whether our hypotheses are true?
* What degree of condifence do we have in our theory?
* What remains to be validated for each given point?

When we have our hypotheses, we can start drilling down and answer why our solution solves the issue. We can then continue to ask **why** to drill even further.


### Toolkits for validating problem painfulness
* Interviews
    * Be aware of confirmation bias
* Shadowing
    * Document the observations
    * In B2B, obsserve how people are working
    * Understand the patterns
* Surveys
    * Do not ask leading questions
    * Ask about similar products
    * Use "The Van Westendorp method" for price
* Focus groups
    * Validate spesific aspects of the solution
    * Make sure the participants fit the target audience
    * The participants should not know each other
    * Avoid leading questions
    * Have 1 person leading, and another one taking notes
* Landing page test / smoke test
    * Used to fake-test something that does not exist
    * Keep it short and compelling
    * Have a clear "call to action" for the user
    * Explain what problem the product is solving
    * Define clearly what is success so we can validate it
* Quantification / how big is the problem?
* Functional prototypes
    * Founders constantly validate too fast and start building the product too quickly
    * Do not optimize for scalability, only do user-facing parts
    * Define clearly what success looks like so it can be validated


### The Van Westendorp method
It is a survey method to find a good price for a product.

Ask to evaluate four spesific price points.
Let the user set the price themself using a slider.
1. too expensive and would not buy (Example $100)
2. expensive but would consider (Example $50)
3. bargain price (Example $30)
4. too cheap and would question the quality (Example $5)


### Degree of validation in B2C
The higher the number, the more certain:
1. Statements of intent
2. Statement of intent with price
3. Sign-up for newsletter
4. Sign-up for trial
5. Activity
6. Recurring activity
7. Revenues
8. Recurring revenues


### Degree of validation in B2B
1. Verbal statement of intent
2. Letter of Intent (LOI)
3. Memorandum of understanding (MOU)
    * A non-binding agreement stating that each party's intend to take action, transaction, or form a new partnership
4. Sale
5. Revenuess
6. Recurring revenues
