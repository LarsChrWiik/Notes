### As a Writer
A writer is free to write and publish on the platform without being a member themself. To earn income from readers, the writer must be a member themself, and be part of the Partner program.

**How to enter the Partner program**
* Be a member
* Have published at least once in the last 6 months
* Be in an eligible country (Norway is eligible)
* 18 years old

**How to get payouts**:
* Have a Stripe account (for payouts)
* Provide your taxpayer information to Tipalti, a third-party payment service
* While you cannot receive payments until you add verified taxpayer information, your posts can accumulate new earnings for up to one month.


### Writer Payment Calculation
**Member reading time**
* Members-only stories will earn money when a member reads your story for 30 seconds or more, and will continue to earn more the longer they keep reading.
* The writer gets paid a slice of the membership fee the reader is paying.

**Positive interactions**
* You will earn more when members clap, highlight, reply, or engage with your story in other ways.

**Follower bonus**
* When members follow you and continue to read and interact with your stories, you will be given a follower bonus.
* Very good to promotes community and audience building.

**Boost bonus**
* Stories that are *Boosted* will also earn more for each read and interaction. Writers should spend more time on fewer, high-quality stories to reach this bar.
* The criteria for getting a "boost" is not clear.
    * "Boosts are for the best personal essays, hidden life wisdom, and deep knowledge that is locked up in each and every one of us".
Referral bonuses
* Is being deprecated
* If you convert a non-paying customer to a paying customer, you get half of their membership fee as income.
* This referral earnings are recurring as long as the reader’s membership plan remains active.

**Anti clickbait**
Stories with a lower than average read-through rate will be adjusted down in earnings, and stories with a higher than average read-through rate will be adjusted up in earnings. Read-through rate is calculated as:
```
Total number of members who read your story for 30+ seconds
-----------------------------------------------------------
      Total number of members who loaded your story
```
So the goal is to retrain most people that clicked on your story.


### Conclusion - How to optimize for reader count
* **Retain readers**: Hook the reader for more than **30 sec**. Having a high read-to-churn ratio when a member lands on your story results in more earnings.
* **Free stories**: Release some work for free content to attract new readers and build a following count.
* **Quality over Quantity**: Spend more time on fewer stories, high-quality stories to reach the "boost" bar.
* **Encourage interaction**: Encourage readers to clap, highlight, reply, or engage with your story.
* **Encourage follow**: Encourage readers to follow you since following results in more earnings.
